# Identity Field Enhancement

Improve the quality of your data by comverting the identity fields into a feature set embedding. The web app demonstrates increase in accuracy metrics after embedding use in modelling.

The tool can be used for datasets which contain datasets with id fields: instead of dropping these columns, users can use the apps to create embeddings for the same, and automatically append them to the original dataset and witness improvement in modelling performance.
